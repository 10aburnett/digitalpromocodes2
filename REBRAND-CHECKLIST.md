# WhopPromoCodes - Complete Rebrand Differentiation Checklist

> **Goal:** Launch WhopPromoCodes as a completely new entity in Google's eyes, avoiding algorithmic suppression and duplicate detection from WHPCodes.

**Status:** IN PROGRESS
**Started:** 2024-12-03
**Last Updated:** 2024-12-03

---

## CRITICAL INSIGHT: Most Content Does NOT Need Rewriting

**Key Discovery:**
- Google only indexed a FEW HUNDRED pages from WHPCodes
- ~5,000+ pages were NOINDEX and Google NEVER saw them
- Those noindex pages are already FRESH and ORIGINAL

**Revised Strategy:**
- Full content rewrite ONLY for pages Google actually indexed (~200-400 pages)
- Layout/structure changes for ALL pages (breaks template similarity)
- Section heading rewrites for ALL pages
- Evidence image changes for ALL pages
- Metadata + JSON-LD regeneration for ALL pages

**This massively reduces workload while still achieving full differentiation.**

---

## Key Decisions Made

- **Writing Style:** Conversion-Optimised Tech-Editorial (authoritative, helpful, structured, persuasive)
- **Structure Approach:** Option A - Full structural reset (RECOMMENDED)
- **Visual Style:** PENDING - To be decided in Day E
- **Rewrite Scope:** Only indexed pages need full rewrite; others get layout/heading changes only

---

## Pre-Deployment Status

- [x] Repo renamed to WhopPromoCodes
- [x] Git disconnected from old WHP Vercel project
- [x] Brand constants updated (SITE_BRAND, SITE_URL, etc.)
- [x] Prisma model renamed (Whop → Deal)
- [x] Middleware deindexing removed
- [x] Robots.txt restored to allow crawling
- [ ] **DO NOT DEPLOY until all steps below are complete**

---

## REVISED ORDER (Content First, Visual Last)

The order has been changed to prioritize content differentiation (Google's primary duplication detector) before visual changes.

---

## STEP 0 — Extract Indexed Pages from WHPCodes GSC (DO THIS FIRST)

> This determines which pages need full rewrites vs. layout-only changes

### 0.1 — Export from Google Search Console
- [ ] Go to GSC → WHPCodes property (https://whpcodes.com)
- [ ] Open Pages → "Indexed" tab
- [ ] Export → Download CSV
- [ ] Save as `whpcodes-indexed-pages.csv`

### 0.2 — Generate Analysis Files
- [ ] Parse CSV to extract all indexed slugs
- [ ] Create `indexed-slugs.json` (pages Google saw - NEED FULL REWRITE)
- [ ] Create `safe-slugs.json` (pages Google never saw - LAYOUT CHANGES ONLY)
- [ ] Create summary report with counts

### 0.3 — Expected Outcome
- ~200-400 pages in `indexed-slugs.json` (require full content rewrite)
- ~5,000+ pages in `safe-slugs.json` (keep content, change layout/headings/images only)

**STEP 0 STATUS:** [ ] NOT STARTED / [ ] IN PROGRESS / [ ] COMPLETE

---

## DAY A — Content Rewrite Foundation (REDUCED SCOPE)

> Tone: authoritative, helpful, slightly journalistic
> Style: structured, detailed, clear, persuasive

### A1 — Full Rewrite for INDEXED Pages Only (~200-400 pages)

## Notes

- Old WHP Vercel project is frozen (Git disconnected)
- whpcodes.com still serving 410/noindex (leave it)
- New repo: https://github.com/10aburnett/WhopPromoCodes
- DO NOT deploy until ALL differentiation steps are complete
- Content rewrites are MORE important than visual changes for Google
- Textual content is Google's PRIMARY duplication detector
